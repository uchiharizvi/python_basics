### String Concatenation and Repetition

Write a Python program that:

	•	Takes two strings from the user (e.g., first name and last name).
	•	Concatenates them into a full name and prints the result.
	•	Prints the full name three times in a row, separated by commas.
Example:

Input: First name: John, Last name: Doe 

Output: John Doe, John Doe, John Doe

### String Slicing
Given the string "Python Programming":

	•	Print the first 6 characters.
	•	Print the last 6 characters.
	•	Print the substring from index 7 to 12.

### Replace a Word in a String

Write a Python program that:

	•	Takes a sentence from the user.
	•	Replaces the word "Python" with "Java" and prints the result.
Example:

Input: "Python is great!"

Output: "Java is great!"

### Basic Math Computations

Write a Python program that:

	•	Takes two numbers from the user.
	•	Prints their sum, difference, product, and division results.

Example:

Input: 

num1 = 10, num2 = 2

Output:

Sum: 12
Difference: 8
Product: 20
Division: 5.0

### String Formatting

Write a Python program that:

	•	Takes a person’s name and age as input from the user.
	•	Prints a sentence in the format: "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

Example:

Input: Name: Alice, Age: 30

Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

### Splitting and Joining Strings

Given the string "apple,banana,cherry,orange", write a program that:

	•	Splits the string into a list of fruits.
	•	Joins the list back into a single string with a space separating each fruit.

Expected Output:

List: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

Joined String: "apple banana cherry orange"

### Convert Integer to String in a Print Statement

Write a program that:

	•	Takes a number from the user and multiplies it by 10.
	•	Prints the result with the sentence: "The result after multiplying by 10 is: [result]", where the result is concatenated properly (as an integer).

Example:

Input: 5

Output: The result after multiplying by 10 is: 50
